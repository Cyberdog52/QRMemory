# QRMemory

This project is for the mobile focus group workshop.

Download or check out the 'Workshop' Directory, where we will work on the Todos to build the QR-Code Memory App.
Try not to look at the Solution ;)

In case you want to skip a Task, you can check out an older commit. I removed the Todos from 6 to 1.

The code originated from the barcode tutorial https://www.appcoda.com/barcode-reader-swift/. I tried to skin the app down and minimize the code and cleaned it up.

Have fun!
